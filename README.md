# App accesos

## Ionic - Angular

#### Start app
```console
ionic serve
```
By default, ionic serve boots up a development server on localhost. To serve to your LAN, specify the --external option, which will use all network interfaces and print the external address(es) on which your app is being served.
```console
ionic serve --external
```
